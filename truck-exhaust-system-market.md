<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Exhaust System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Exhaust System</li><li>Dual Exhaust System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The truck exhaust system market consists of two main types: single exhaust system and dual exhaust system. In a single exhaust system, the truck has only one exhaust pipe that collects and releases the exhaust gases from the engine. On the other hand, a dual exhaust system has two separate exhaust pipes, usually one on each side of the vehicle. This system allows for better engine performance and increased airflow, resulting in enhanced horsepower and a deeper exhaust sound.</p></p>
