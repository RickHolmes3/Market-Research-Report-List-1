<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Cryo Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injection Liquid Type</li><li>Cryopump of Closed Cycle Gas Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum cryo pumps are used to maintain extremely low pressures in various applications. The injection liquid type of vacuum cryo pump uses a warm-up valve to inject liquid nitrogen into the pump, which evaporates and removes gas molecules. On the other hand, the cryopump of closed cycle gas type uses a closed-loop system to circulate cold gas, such as helium or nitrogen, to cool the pump's surfaces and condense gas molecules. Both types of pumps effectively achieve high vacuum levels by removing gas molecules from the system.</p></p>
