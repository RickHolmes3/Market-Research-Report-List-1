<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-TIGIT Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monotherapy</li><li>Combination Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-TIGIT antibody market consists of two main types: monotherapy and combination therapy. Monotherapy refers to the use of anti-TIGIT antibodies as a standalone treatment for cancer or other diseases by targeting the TIGIT protein, which helps tumor cells evade the immune system. On the other hand, combination therapy involves combining anti-TIGIT antibodies with other drugs or treatments to enhance their effectiveness. This approach aims to enhance the immune response and improve patient outcomes by targeting multiple pathways involved in immune evasion.</p></p>
