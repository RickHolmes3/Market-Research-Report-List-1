<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Power Converter System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Doubly-Fed</li><li>Full Power</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wind Power Converter System market consists of two main types: Doubly-Fed and Full Power. Doubly-Fed Wind Power Converter Systems use a partially rated converter in the rotor circuit, enabling variable speed operation and allowing power to flow bidirectionally between the grid and the generator. Full Power Wind Power Converter Systems, on the other hand, use a fully rated converter in the stator circuit, enabling direct grid connection with fixed or variable speed operation. Both systems are used to convert wind energy into electrical power but have different mechanisms for achieving this.</p></p>
