<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shrinkage-Reducing Admixtures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shrinkage-reducing admixtures are used in construction to minimize drying shrinkage and cracking of concrete. The market is divided into two types: powder and liquid. Powder admixtures are dry, granular substances that are mixed with water or added directly to the concrete mix. Liquid admixtures, on the other hand, are liquid-based solutions that are directly added to the concrete mix. Both types of admixtures work to reduce shrinkage and improve the overall strength and durability of concrete structures.</p></p>
