<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-Function Heat Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2 Pipes System</li><li>4 Pipes System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The multi-function heat pumps market can be categorized into two types: the 2 pipes system and the 4 pipes system. In a 2 pipes system, the heat pump serves a dual purpose of providing both heating and cooling functions. However, it can only perform one function at a time, either heating or cooling. On the other hand, the 4 pipes system allows for simultaneous operation of both heating and cooling functions, making it more flexible and efficient. Both systems are used in various applications to regulate indoor temperatures effectively.</p></p>
