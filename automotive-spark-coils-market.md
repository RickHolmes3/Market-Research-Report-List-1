<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Spark Coils Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Spark</li><li>Multi-Spark</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Spark Coils have two main types of market variations: Single-Spark and Multi-Spark. Single-Spark coils are responsible for delivering a single electrical spark to ignite the air-fuel mixture in each individual cylinder of an internal combustion engine, ensuring efficient combustion. On the other hand, Multi-Spark coils generate multiple sparks per ignition cycle, rapidly igniting the mixture and improving the engine's overall performance. The Single-Spark coils are commonly found in standard engines, while the Multi-Spark coils are more common in high-performance or high-compression engines.</p></p>
