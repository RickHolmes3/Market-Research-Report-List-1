<p><h1>Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) Stent Grafts Market Size Growing and Forecasted for period from 2023 - 2030 and provides complete market analysis of this market</h1></p><p><strong>Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) Stent Grafts Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). It involves the placement of a stent graft within the aorta to strengthen the weakened wall and prevent rupture. EVAR stent grafts are typically made of a metal frame covered with fabric, and they are designed to conform to the shape of the aorta.</p><p>The market for EVAR stent grafts has been experiencing steady growth. The increasing prevalence of AAA, coupled with the advantages offered by EVAR over traditional open surgery, has been driving market demand. EVAR is less invasive, associated with shorter hospital stays, reduced mortality rates, and faster recovery times. These factors have led to increased adoption rates by both patients and healthcare providers.</p><p>The market analysis suggests that technological advancements in stent graft design, such as the introduction of fenestrated and branched grafts, are further driving market growth. These innovations allow for the treatment of more complex anatomies, expanding the patient population suitable for EVAR procedures.</p><p>Additionally, the increasing geriatric population and rising healthcare expenditure are deemed to propel market growth in the coming years. However, the market is not without challenges. Limited reimbursement policies, high costs associated with the procedure, and the risk of complications are some factors that may hinder market growth to some extent.</p><p>Overall, the global EVAR stent grafts market is anticipated to witness significant growth in the forecast period. With a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.9%, the market is expected to present lucrative opportunities for manufacturers, healthcare providers, and investors in the near future.</p></p>
