<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Slow Release Fertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Type</li><li>Granular Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrogen slow release fertilizers are categorized into liquid type and granular type. Liquid type fertilizers are soluble nitrogen sources that are mixed with water and applied to the soil or plants. They provide a quick release of nitrogen and are generally used for short-term needs. On the other hand, granular type fertilizers release nitrogen slowly over time as the granules break down. They are applied to the soil and provide a more sustained release of nitrogen, making them suitable for long-term plant nutrition.</p></p>
