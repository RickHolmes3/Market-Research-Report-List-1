<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Network Hubs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Network hubs can be categorized into two market types: active and passive. Active hubs contain built-in electronics that regenerate and amplify signals, allowing for longer distances between devices. They can also adjust signal speeds to accommodate different devices. On the other hand, passive hubs simply broadcast incoming signals to all connected devices without any amplification or regeneration. As a result, passive hubs are limited to shorter distances between devices and cannot adjust signal speeds.</p></p>
