<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Refractory Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brick Refractories</li><li>Monolithic Refractories</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Steel refractory materials are used in the steel industry to resist high temperatures and harsh conditions. There are two types of steel refractory materials: brick refractories and monolithic refractories. Brick refractories are made from ceramic materials and shaped like bricks for easy installation and replacement. Monolithic refractories, on the other hand, are made from a single, homogenous material and are typically applied as a mixture that hardens and forms a protective lining. Both types of refractories play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of steel production processes.</p></p>
