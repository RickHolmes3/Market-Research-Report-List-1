<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polypropylene Fiber for Medical Masks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>≤35 g/10 min</li><li>> 35 g/10 min</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Polypropylene Fiber for Medical Masks market can be classified into two types based on their melt flow rate (MFR): ≤35 g/10 min and >35 g/10 min. MFR refers to the measurement of the polymer's viscosity during the melting process, indicating its ability to flow. Masks made from polypropylene fibers with MFR ≤35 g/10 min are typically more durable and have higher tensile strength, making them suitable for long-term use. On the other hand, masks made from polypropylene fibers with MFR >35 g/10 min are generally more lightweight and offer enhanced breathability, making them more comfortable to wear.</p></p>
