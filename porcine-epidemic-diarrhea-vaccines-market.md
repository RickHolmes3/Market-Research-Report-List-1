<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) vaccines are categorized into two types: live vaccines and killed vaccines. Live vaccines contain a weakened form of the virus that causes PED, stimulating the pig's immune system to produce a response and develop immunity. On the other hand, killed vaccines contain inactivated virus particles, which also provoke an immune response from the pig but do not cause active infection. Both types of vaccines aim to protect pigs from PED by stimulating their immune system to recognize and fight against the virus.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Vaccines Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piglets</li><li>Adults Pigs</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) vaccines are used in both piglets and adult pigs to prevent and control the spread of the viral disease. In piglets, these vaccines help to boost their immune system and provide protection against the PED virus, reducing the severity and duration of diarrhea and ultimately preventing mortality. In adult pigs, the vaccines aid in maintaining their immunity to the virus, preventing reinfection and minimizing the risk of transmission. This application of PED vaccines is crucial for the swine industry to ensure the health and productivity of pig populations.</p></p>
