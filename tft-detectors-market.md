<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TFT Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TFT Detectors are used in imaging technology to detect and convert X-ray photons into electrical signals. There are two types of TFT Detectors: Indirect Conversion and Direct Conversion. Indirect Conversion detectors use scintillator materials to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then further converted into electrical signals using thin-film transistors (TFTs). On the other hand, Direct Conversion detectors directly convert X-rays into electrical signals using semiconductor materials, eliminating the need for scintillators. Both types have their advantages and applications, depending on factors like image quality, radiation dose, and cost.</p></p>
