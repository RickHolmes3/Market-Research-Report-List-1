<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fully Automated External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Wave</li><li>Biphase Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Fully Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) market comprises two types of waveforms: Single Phase Wave and Biphase Wave. Single Phase Wave defibrillators utilize a lower energy level and deliver a single phase electrical shock to the heart, while Biphase Wave defibrillators use a higher energy level and deliver a two-phase electrical shock. Both types aim to restore normal heart rhythm by delivering an electric current through paddles or electrode pads placed on the chest. These AEDs are crucial in treating sudden cardiac arrest by detecting abnormal heart rhythms and providing life-saving electrical shocks.</p></p>
