<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chordal Suture System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Loop Chordal Suture System</li><li>Doubled-armed Chordal Suture System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The chordal suture system market consists of two main types: loop chordal suture system and doubled-armed chordal suture system. The loop chordal suture system is designed with a single strand looped through the valve leaflet and attached to the papillary muscle, providing support and stability. On the other hand, the doubled-armed chordal suture system uses two separate strands, allowing for additional control and flexibility in securing the valve leaflet to the papillary muscle. Both systems are utilized in heart surgeries to repair or replace damaged heart valves.</p></p>
