<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Ventilation Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The metal ventilation fan market can be classified into two main types: axial and centrifugal fans. Axial fans are designed to move air parallel to the fan blade axis, resulting in a horizontal or vertical airflow. They are ideal for applications that require large amounts of airflow at a low pressure. On the other hand, centrifugal fans move air radially from the center outward, generating a higher pressure. These fans are suitable for systems that require high pressure or when the airflow needs to be redirected, such as in ventilation systems or HVAC units.</p></p>
