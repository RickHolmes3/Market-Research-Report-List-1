<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prostate Cancer Nuclear Medicine Diagnostics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SPECT</li><li>PET</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Prostate cancer nuclear medicine diagnostics refer to the use of radioactive substances to detect and diagnose prostate cancer. Two common types of nuclear medicine diagnostics are Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). SPECT involves injecting a radioactive tracer into the patient's bloodstream and using a specialized camera to capture images of the prostate. PET, on the other hand, uses a different type of radioactive tracer to produce detailed 3D images of the prostate. Both SPECT and PET are valuable tools for detecting and evaluating prostate cancer.</p></p>
