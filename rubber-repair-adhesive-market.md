<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Repair Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Bond</li><li>Cold Bond</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The rubber repair adhesive market can be categorized into two types: hot bond and cold bond. Hot bond refers to the process of using heat to soften and activate the adhesive, allowing for the bonding of rubber components. This method requires specialized equipment and skilled operators. On the other hand, cold bond involves using adhesive compounds that do not require heat activation, making it easier and more convenient to apply. Cold bond adhesives are generally less expensive and can be self-adhesive or require the use of a primer for proper bonding.</p></p>
