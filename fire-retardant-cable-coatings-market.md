<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Retardant Cable Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intumescent Fire Retardant Cable Coatings</li><li>Non-Intumescent Fire Retardant Cable Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire retardant cable coatings market consists of two main types: intumescent fire retardant cable coatings and non-intumescent fire retardant cable coatings. Intumescent coatings expand when exposed to high temperatures, forming a thick insulating layer that protects the cable from fire and heat. Non-intumescent coatings, on the other hand, do not expand but instead provide a barrier that inhibits the fire from spreading. Both types of coatings are specifically designed to enhance the fire resistance of cables and ensure the safety of electrical installations.</p></p>
