<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar-powered Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Suction</li><li>Submersible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar-powered pump market consists of two types: surface suction pumps and submersible pumps. A surface suction pump is designed to draw water from a shallow water source, such as a well or a river. It utilizes a suction pipe that is placed above the water level to pull water into the pump. On the other hand, a submersible pump is immersed in the water source and generally used to access deeper water reservoirs like boreholes. These pumps operate by pushing water to the surface through a pipe system. Both types of pumps harness solar energy for power, making them environmentally friendly and cost-effective.</p></p>
