<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gastric Duodenal Levin Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Silicone Rubber Feeding Tube</li><li>PVC Feeding Tube</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The gastric duodenal levin tubes market consists of two types: silicone rubber feeding tubes and PVC feeding tubes. Silicone rubber feeding tubes are made of a flexible material that is resistant to deformation and can be easily inserted into the patient's gastrointestinal tract. PVC feeding tubes, on the other hand, are made of a rigid material and are less flexible than silicone rubber tubes. Both types of tubes are used for enteral feeding and are commonly used in medical settings to provide nutrition to patients who are unable to eat or swallow.</p></p>
